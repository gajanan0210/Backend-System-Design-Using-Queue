# Backend System Design Using Queue

## Objective
Design and implement a backend system that efficiently manages requests from multiple users using a queue structure. Each client connected will have its queue where all requests will be processed sequentially. The system is robust and scalable, ensuring that the queue is empty once all requests are processed and all users disconnect.

## Requirements
1. **User Authentication**: Securely authenticate users before they can enqueue requests.
2. **Request Queueing**: Implement a queue for each client to handle requests in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) manner.
3. **Request Processing**: Develop a process to handle and execute requests sequentially.
4. **Concurrency Management**: Handle multiple clients and their queues concurrently.
5. **Scalability**: Ensure the system can scale to handle an increasing number of users and requests without degradation in performance.
6. **Robustness**: Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms to manage failures without data loss.
7. **Logging and Monitoring**: Set up logging for tracking request handling and system monitoring for performance metrics.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Node.js
- **Messaging/Queueing System**: RabbitMQ
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Monitoring Tools**: Prometheus, Grafana

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/backend-system.git
   cd backend-system



## Install dependencies:

    ```bash

    npm install



## Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:


JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/backend-system RABBITMQ_URL=amqp://your_rabbitmq_url


## Start the MongoDB server:
Ensure MongoDB is running on your system. You can start MongoDB using:

```bash
mongod

Start the RabbitMQ server:
Ensure RabbitMQ is running on your system. You can start RabbitMQ using:

rabbitmq-server

Run the application:
node server.js

Usage
Register a new user:
Send a POST request to /register with a JSON body containing username and password.

Login:
Send a POST request to /login with a JSON body containing username and password. You will receive a JWT token.

Enqueue a request:
Send a POST request to /enqueue with a JSON body containing your request data. Include the JWT token in the Authorization header.

Metrics:
Send a GET request to /metrics to retrieve the system metrics.

Error Handling and Recovery
The system includes error handling and recovery mechanisms to manage failures without data loss.

Logging and Monitoring
Logging is set up for tracking request handling. Monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana are set up for performance metrics.
